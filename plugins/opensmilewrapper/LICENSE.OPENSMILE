About openSMILE:
================

openSMILE is a complete and open-source toolkit for audio analysis, 
processing and classification especially targeted at speech and music applications, 
e.g. ASR, emotion recognition, or beat tracking and chord detection.
The toolkit was developed at the Institute for Human-Machine Communication 
at the Technische Universitaet Muenchen in Munich, Germany.
It was started within the SEMAINE EU-FP7 research project.
The toolkit is now further maintained and developed
by audEERING UG (limited), which provides intelligent
audio analysis solutions and consulting services.
An open-source version for private use, education, and research
will always be available, next to commercial versions with
additional features (such as more interface components) or commercial
licenses for the basic version.


Third-party dependencies:
=========================

openSMILE uses LibSVM (by Chih-Chung Chang and Chih-Jen Lin) for 
classification tasks. It is distributed with openSMILE and is
 included in the src/classifiers/libsvm/ directory.

PortAudio is required for live recording from sound card and for 
the SEMAINE component.
You can get it from: http://www.portaudio.com
A working snapshot is included in thirdparty/portaudio.tgz

Optionally, openSMILE can be linked against the SEMAINE API 
and the Julius LVCSR engine, enabling an interface to the 
SEMAINE system and a keyword spotter component. 
See http://www.semaine-project.eu/ for details on running the 
SEMAINE system.
Only the older versions (1.0.1) are supported with the SEMAINE 
system.

openSMILE uses rapidjson to read RNN files in json format.
Rapidjson can be obtained from: https://code.google.com/p/rapidjson/
It is distributed under the MIT license and included
in src/include/rapidjson


Documentation/Installing/Using:
===============================

openSMILE is well documented in the openSMILE book, which can be 
found in doc/openSMILE_book.pdf.


Developers:
===========

Incomplete developer's documentation can be found in "doc/developer" 
and in the openSMILE book.

Information on how to write and compile run-time linkable plug-ins 
for openSMILE, see the openSMILE book or take a look at the files 
in the "plugindev" directory, especially the README file.


Getting more help:
==================

If you encounter problems with openSMILE, and solve them yourself, 
please do inform Florian Eyben via e-mail (fe@audeering.com), 
so the documentation can be updated!

If you cannot solve the problems yourself, please do also contact
Florian Eyben so we can solve the problem together and update 
the documentation.
